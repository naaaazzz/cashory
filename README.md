Cashory Demo is a full-stack personal finance and lightweight invoicing application built as a Bun monorepo. It combines an Expo-powered React Native client, a Hono API, Better Auth authentication, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL to deliver a mobile-first experience for onboarding users, managing wallets, recording transactions, reviewing reports, generating invoices, and exporting invoice PDFs.

> Repository audit note  
> This codebase currently implements a finance management product, not a YouTube long-form video creation and publishing workflow. There is no YouTube API, Google OAuth for YouTube upload, video rendering pipeline, or publishing automation in the repository at this time. This README documents the current implementation on disk so other developers can set it up and contribute accurately.

## Project Overview

Cashory Demo helps a user move through a simple money-management lifecycle:

1. **Authenticate** with email and password.
2. **Complete onboarding** by filling in profile data and selecting preferences.
3. **Create wallets** to represent cash, bank, credit, or mobile balances.
4. **Organize categories** for income and expenses.
5. **Add transactions** and review historical activity with filtering and summaries.
6. **Track invoices** for client work, update invoice status, and generate PDF exports.
7. **Review notifications and profile settings** from the in-app settings area.

For developers, the project demonstrates a strongly typed monorepo where schemas, environment validation, authentication, and database logic are shared across client and server packages.

## Feature Highlights

- **Mobile-first UX** with Expo Router navigation, onboarding screens, drawer and tab layouts, theming, and HeroUI Native components.
- **Typed API layer** using Hono on the server and Hono client bindings in the mobile app.
- **Authentication** with Better Auth, secure Expo storage, and session-aware API requests.
- **Finance data model** for wallets, categories, transactions, budgets, notifications, and invoices.
- **Invoice lifecycle support** including status changes, notification generation, server-side HTML creation, and client-side PDF export and sharing.
- **Shared schemas and validation** with Zod and workspace packages to reduce duplication across the stack.

## Technical Architecture

### Monorepo Layout

- `apps/native` contains the React Native application built with Expo and Expo Router.
- `apps/server` contains the Hono API, route registration, middleware, and business services.
- `packages/auth` centralizes Better Auth configuration and database-backed auth setup.
- `packages/db` contains Drizzle configuration, PostgreSQL schema definitions, and migrations.
- `packages/env` validates native and server environment variables with `@t3-oss/env-core`.
- `packages/schema` provides shared Zod schemas and input contracts for API operations.
- `packages/config` stores shared TypeScript configuration.

### Request Flow

1. The mobile app authenticates with Better Auth through the server.
2. Session state is stored using the Expo Better Auth client and secure storage.
3. The mobile app calls the Hono API through a typed client and injects the auth cookie.
4. Hono middleware validates the session and exposes `userId` to route handlers.
5. Service functions interact with PostgreSQL through Drizzle ORM.
6. Shared Zod schemas validate request payloads and query parameters.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd cashory-demo
bun install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create the server environment file at `apps/server/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cashory
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-secret-at-least-32-characters-long
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8081
NODE_ENV=development
```

Create the native environment file at `apps/native/.env`:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Prepare the database

Push the current schema to PostgreSQL:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Optional database commands:

```bash
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:studio
```

### 4. Start the development environment

Run both the API and mobile app:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run the server only:

```bash
bun run dev:server
```

Run the mobile app only:

```bash
bun run dev:native
```

### 5. Check types before opening a pull request

```bash
bun run check-types
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Scope | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Server | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string used by Drizzle and runtime DB access |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Server | Yes | Secret used by Better Auth for signing and session security |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Server | Yes | Base URL for Better Auth endpoints |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Server | Yes | Allowed origin for client requests |
| `NODE_ENV` | Server | Yes | Runtime environment, defaults to `development` |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` | Native | Yes | Base URL used by the Expo app for API requests |

### Authentication Configuration

- The server uses Better Auth with a Drizzle adapter backed by PostgreSQL.
- The native app uses the Expo Better Auth client with secure storage.
- Trusted origins include the configured CORS origin and native schemes used by the Expo app.

### Database Configuration

- Drizzle reads schema files from `packages/db/src/schema`.
- Drizzle Kit reads `DATABASE_URL` from `apps/server/.env`.
- A local Supabase configuration exists under `packages/db/supabase` for local database tooling.

### YouTube API Integration Status

The repository does **not** currently include any of the following:

- YouTube Data API credentials
- Google OAuth client setup for YouTube publishing
- Video upload or scheduling endpoints
- Rendering, transcoding, thumbnail generation, or script-to-video automation

If the product is intended to evolve into a YouTube publishing system, you will need to add new environment variables, API routes, background processing, and storage workflows before a YouTube configuration section would be actionable.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Create an account

- Launch the native app from Expo.
- Register with email and password from the sign-up screen.
- Existing users can sign in from the sign-in screen.

### 2. Complete onboarding

## Contribution Guidelines

### Development Principles

- Keep shared contracts in `packages/schema` whenever client and server both depend on them.
- Update `packages/env` when adding new environment variables.
- Prefer typed API access through the existing Hono client instead of creating ad hoc fetch wrappers.
- Follow existing naming and folder conventions for screens, hooks, services, and schema files.

### Recommended Contribution Flow

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Install dependencies with `bun install`.
3. Run the database locally and configure environment variables.
4. Implement the change in the appropriate app or shared package.
5. Run `bun run check-types`.
6. Open a pull request with a clear summary of user-facing and technical changes.

### Current Quality Gates

- `bun run check-types` is available at the workspace level.
- No workspace `lint` or automated test script is currently defined in the repository root.
- When adding new functionality, include verification steps in your pull request description.

## License

There is currently **no `LICENSE` file** in this repository. Until a license is added by the maintainers, the project should be treated as all rights reserved.

If you plan to distribute or open-source the project, add a license file and update this section accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Environment validation fails on startup

- Recheck `apps/server/.env` and `apps/native/.env`.
- Make sure required values are present and valid URLs where applicable.
- Ensure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is at least 32 characters long.

### The Expo app cannot reach the API

- Confirm the server is running.
- Confirm `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` points to the reachable API host.
- If testing on a physical device, replace `localhost` with your machine's LAN IP.

### Authentication returns unauthorized

- Verify `BETTER_AUTH_URL` matches the actual API origin.
- Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` matches the client origin used during development.
- Restart both the server and Expo after changing auth-related environment variables.

### Database commands fail

- Confirm PostgreSQL is running and accepting connections.
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/server/.env`.
- Re-run `bun run db:push` after fixing connectivity or credential issues.

### PDF sharing does not open on device

- PDF export depends on `expo-print` and `expo-sharing`.
- Some simulators and environments have limited share-sheet support.
- Test on a physical device if share functionality appears unavailable.

### Metro or Expo behaves inconsistently

- Restart Expo with a cleared cache:

```bash
bun run dev:native
```

- If needed, start Expo directly with:

```bash
cd apps/native
bun run dev
```
